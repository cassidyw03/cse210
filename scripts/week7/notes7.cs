// a getter gets something that is private
// Inheritance! 
// public abstract void Class(); === any child of this class must implement this
// if you have abstract methods, you need an abstract class
// override: overrides method that exists already, overrides parent's rules
// when u have abstract class, you can do normal methods, abstract methods, or virtual methods.... virtual means you provide the logic (you don't trust your children
// can't override unless specified that it's allowed
// abstract classes are blueprintsssss, grab a child that is fully built not the blueprint
// any time you inherit from a parent, you must call the parent, it class extends other class
